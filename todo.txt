Short term:
- README.md



Long term:
- try to detect album cover and attach it to each converted file
- file extension
- accept naming convention format from user
- maybe make the ffmpeg command an fstring, referencing variables that can be assigned each iteration of the conversion
- output/debug --- progressed
- return value?
- some kind of premliminary probing (we don't want psychos trying to convert a cue file for a an album that's already been converted into tracks!
- ask the user for confirmation after parsing the file before trying to convert it

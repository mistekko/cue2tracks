I've always had a difficult time journalling. Some find it fairly easy to stay 
in the habit of writing every day, but remembering to do anything everyday is 
very difficult for me. Perhaps because of my frighteningly short attention span?
Or perhaps I have some other inborn tendency that inhibits my ability to build 
habits. I struggle to imagine my tendency towards obsession as fully seperate
from this 
issue.
It is also likely that my (relative) pragmatism plays a part in this: I struggle
to intuit a use of regularly performing the same action without a clear cause
and desired effect each time; I only write when I have something I would like to 
have written about, read when I've got something I want to have read, code when 
there's a tool I want to use that hasn't been made yet, and so on.
